                <p class="review"> "Our team decided that we should do a team building venture and we are happy that we went with the Whitewater Rafting Company. They served as a perfect experience to learn and grow as a team. 
                    We were surprized at how much closer we all became as we rafted on the river together. Our team will be booking another trip next season!" - CEO, Mark Grover

                    <div><p class="grid-find-item2"> Our company, the Whitewater Rafting Company, has a proud history of serving in the local community. We have been operating since 1999, 
                        when our founder, Titus B. Simmons, dedicated his time to serving as a river guide. Mr. Simmons was taught about river rafting by his father and uncle as soon as he could swim. Since then, he has loved sharing 
                        the joy of river rafting with everyone interested and looking for adventure.</p></div>

                        During Mr. Simmons' venture as a guide, he discovered to growing need for a rafting company and created this company with a few other local river guides.
                        The Whitewater Rafting Company began small, and now hosts multiple tours and trips weekly in the season.
                        The Whitewater Rafting Company is always excited to share the same joy as our founder, Mr. Simmons.
