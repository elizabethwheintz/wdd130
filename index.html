            <p>My name is Elizabeth Heintz. I am the youngest of nine children.
                I grew up in California, but Washington State is now my home.
                I love my family and I like to create different artistic things, like sewing, painting, drawing, crocheting, bookbinding, and so on.
                My favorite thing to do is help others, whether it's teaching or supporting, I find a lot of joy in serving how Christ would serve.

            <p> The State of Washington is located in the Pacific North-west corner of the United States. 
                In 1889, the state became the 42nd state in the country and was named after George Washington. 
                Washington is best known for it's rainy weather and breathtaking scenery. </p>
