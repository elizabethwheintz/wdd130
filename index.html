            <p> My name is Elizabeth Heintz. I am the youngest of nine children, five boys and four girls.
                I grew up in California, but Washington State is my home now.
                I love my family, I've been blessed with a close relationship with my brothers and sisters.
                I like to create different artistic things, like sewing, painting, drawing, crocheting, bookbinding, and so on.
                My favorite thing to do is help others, whether it's teaching or supporting, I find a lot of joy in serving how Christ would serve.
                One of my favorite places to serve on earth is in the temple to be a proxy for my ancestors so they may receive the blessings promised
                in the holy temples and be given the opportunity to learn the plan of salvation. Temples are important to me because they give my family
                a connection to the past and tether us to eternity.
