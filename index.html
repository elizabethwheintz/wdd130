            <p>My name is Elizabeth Heintz. I am the youngest of nine children.
                I grew up in California and have a great relationship with my siblings. 
                I love my family. I'm the only lefty in my family, so that's fun. 
                I love to create different artistic things, like sewing, painting, drawing, crocheting, bookbinding, and so on.
                My favorite thing to do is help others, whether is teaching or supporting, I find a lot of joy in service.
